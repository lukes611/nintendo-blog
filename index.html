            This was my first time playing a Zelda game and it was really great. I felt like I could really sink into the world of this game. I love the top down drawn art in the game. I loved the shrinking ability which essentially doubled the world size because you could explore everywhere from a new perspective. The puzzles and dungeons were really fun to explore too.

            I particularly loved the music in this game, there were also several animations like falling, swinging the sword, riding the kart which really stood out to me. This game was probably the most difficult game I've played so far, I do wish it was a little easier at times - mainly I wish breakable items and enemies gave more hearts rather than rupees. I really loved the keystone collecting and how it was part of the culture of the world yet it had a real game effect. Mastering all the weapons and unlocking them was also extremely fun.

            I wish the story was a little more in-depth but it was pretty nice to be honest. The dungeons were really fun, I did need to use a guide to solve everything - I think I'm still not that good at this style of game yet - but I really don't mind, I still solved the majority on my own.

                I loved some of Kirby's animations in this game. The sleeping animation in the bed was so cute! All of the ability costumes Kirby wore were also. The gameplay was extremely fluid and gave you a real sense of freedom. I especially loved the beach levels, the crystal water looked so good and the whole vibe really cheered me up.

                Some of the boss battles were pretty challenging, I was at the edge of my seat playing them on a number of times. The rest of the levels were mostly quite easy and fun though - which I count as a big positive since I'm not that good at games yet.

                I did find some of the enemies too cute, like it didn't seem like they should be enemies and I remember thinking it was a bit confusing. I found the time challenge levels really fun and the overworld was a really nice way to choose levels.

                I played Kirby's dreamland 2 when I was a kid so this is the second Kirby game I've played and it was really great.
                I would say, since I played this game right after Paper Mario I did find the story a little too simple, even though the idea was really good. I think they could have encorporated it a bit more.

        <h1>Paper Mario: The Origami King (2020)</h1>
        <h3>Played: March 2023</h3>

                I loved Paper Mario so much, this is the first Mario game I've played and it really stood out! I loved the paper aestetic, the quirky characters, the funny dialogs that made me laugh out lout, the sad moments that genuinely made my cry a few times and the beautiful lands in the game. The battle system was really unique and could be quite challenging due to the time constraint. I especially loved the boss battles, battling stationary like the scissors and the hole punch were really interesting due to the ring battle system. Olivia was such a standout. Running into Luigi every so often thinking he finally got the next piece of the puzzle only to find out he'd accidentally found a different yet still important piece was really funny. I feel like the game setup so many interesting moments and really made the whole world really believable.
                I'm definately going to try to play all of the paper mario games now!
